Repository of an encryption algorithm using Java The program should be able to handle the encryption and decryption of messages and files (of all types). A graphical interface to simplify the functioning thereof must also be developed. Use variables wherever possible, e.g. the size of the shifting of characters, to make the program more general. Any programming language may be used. A short report on what had been done and how the algorithms function should be compiled and handed in along with example code of the encryption and decryption parts of each algorithm. (A type of user manual for the program). You must be able to answer questions on the programming and other aspects. The following algorithms should be implemented: substitution - Vigenère Transposition – column Vernam Own
